# Description
- Non-working image annotation plugin for OSD. 

# Notes
- If you want to connect these annotations to a database, fill out the createNewSerialization(), updateSerialization(), and deleteAnnotation() methods. Commented out Django ajax code is there for reference.
- Otherwise, you can serialize using JSON.
